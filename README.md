# BlackScholesPINN

A Python implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the Black-Scholes partial differential equation used in option pricing.

## ðŸ“Œ What is this?

This repository demonstrates how to use Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to learn the solution of the **Black-Scholes equation** â€” a foundational model in financial mathematics for pricing European call options.

PINNs are neural networks that are trained not just on data, but also on the **underlying physical (or financial) laws** described by differential equations.
